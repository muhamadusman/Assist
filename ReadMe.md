This repository includes Generative AI for medical imaging, primarily focused on Brain MRI

Training several of the generative models and all the segmentation networks was performed using the supercomputing resource Berzelius (752 Nvidia A100 GPUs) provided by the National Supercomputer Centre at Linköping University, Sweden. It was donated by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation. 

This research was supported by the ITEA/VINNOVA project ASSIST (Automation, Surgery Support and Intuitive 3D visualization to optimize workflow in IGT SysTems, 2021-01954), LiU Cancer and the Åke Wiberg foundation. Anders Eklund has previously received graphics hardware from Nvidia.
